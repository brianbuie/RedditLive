## Built with

jQuery

Sends periodic AJAX requests to Reddit API to get information for given subreddit and selected comment thread. 

Reddit rate-limits requests, so hosting on a server would require serious AJAX nerfing, which would make this useless.

It requires no setup or permissions, so feel free to download and try it yourself!
